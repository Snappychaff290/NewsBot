            Provide analysis covering:
            1. **What's Really Happening** - Strip away the spin and identify the core facts
            2. **Who Benefits** - Which groups, companies, or political actors gain from each narrative

            4. **What's Being Omitted** - Important context or opposing viewpoints being downplayed or ignored
            5. **Cui Bono** - Follow the money/power - who wins if readers believe this narrative
            6. **Propaganda Techniques** - Identify emotional manipulation, loaded language, or selective fact presentation
            
            Be brutally honest. Ignore political correctness entirely. Both left and right wing sources push agendas. Call out manipulation regardless of which "side" is doing it. Look for:
